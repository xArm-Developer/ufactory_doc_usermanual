# 3. Continuous Linear Motion

#### Waiting

In the `set_position()` interface for linear motion, the `wait` parameter is used to set whether to wait or not.

* `wait=True` means that the next command to the robotic arm will be sent only after the current command is completed.
* `wait=False` means that after sending the current command, the next command will be sent immediately regardless of whether the robotic arm has completed its execution.

For example, to make the robotic arm move to the following four points (A, B, C, D) at a speed of 200 mm/s without waiting between commands:

* Point A: `[300, 100, 150, 180, 0, 0]`
* Point B: `[300, -100, 150, 180, 0, 0]`
* Point C: `[400, -100, 150, 180, 0, 0]`
* Point D: `[400, 100, 150, 180, 0, 0]`

The complete code is as follows:

```
from xarm.wrapper import XArmAPI  
arm = XArmAPI('192.168.1.47')  

arm.motion_enable(enable=True)  
arm.set_mode(0)  
arm.set_state(0)

arm.set_position(300, 100, 150, 180, 0, 0, speed=200, wait=False)  
arm.set_position(300, -100, 150, 180, 0, 0, speed=200, wait=False)  
arm.set_position(400, -100, 150, 180, 0, 0, speed=200, wait=False)  
arm.set_position(400, 100, 150, 180, 0, 0, speed=200, wait=False)
```

#### Blending Radius

The blending radius is similar to the turning radius of a car. When a blending radius greater than 0 is set, the robotic arm's trajectory becomes smoother during turns. In the `set_position()` interface for linear motion, the blending radius is passed through the `radius` parameter. The `radius` parameter is only effective when `wait=False`, and its setting affects the continuity of the trajectory.

The table below shows the relationship between trajectory continuity and the `wait` and `radius` parameters:

| Parameter  | radius < 0    | radius ≥ 0    |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| wait=True  | Discontinuous | Discontinuous |
| wait=False | Discontinuous | Continuous    |

Therefore, continuous linear motion can only be achieved when `wait=False` and `radius ≥ 0`.

#### Continuous Linear Motion

The conditions required for continuous linear motion are:

* At least two Cartesian commands are needed.
* `wait=False`
* `radius ≥ 0`

The following is an example of continuous linear motion with a blending radius of 5 mm:

```
from xarm.wrapper import XArmAPI  
arm=XArmAPI('192.168.1.47')  
arm.motion_enable(enable=True)  
arm.set_mode(0)  
arm.set_state(0)  
  
arm.set_position(300,100,150,180,0,0,speed=200,wait=False,radius=5)  
arm.set_position(300,-100,150,180,0,0,speed=200,wait=False,radius=5)  
arm.set_position(400,-100,150,180,0,0,speed=200,wait=False,radius=5)  
arm.set_position(400,100,150,180,0,0,speed=200,wait=False,radius=5)
```
