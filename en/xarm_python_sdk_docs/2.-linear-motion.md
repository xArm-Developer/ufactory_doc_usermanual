# 2. Linear motion

### 1. Linear Motion

#### Initialization

Assume the robotic arm controller's IP address is 192.168.1.47, initialize the robotic arm.

```
from xarm.wrapper import XArmAPI  
arm=XArmAPI('192.168.1.47')
```

#### Enable

If the robotic arm is not enabled, it needs to be enabled. Once enabled, there is no need to enable it again.

```
arm.motion_enable(enable=True)
```

#### Set Mode and State

After enabling, you need to set the mode and state for the robotic arm to move.\
The robotic arm has multiple modes; the commonly used linear motion and joint motion are both position commands, i.e., mode 0.

```
arm.set_mode(0)
```

The robotic arm can be set to various modes. Mode 0 is for motion, mode 3 is for pausing the motion, and mode 4 is for stopping the motion.

```
arm.set_state(0)
```

#### Send Position Command

In the xArm-Python-SDK, the Cartesian position is defined as x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw.\
The unit for distance is millimeters (mm), and the default angle representation is degrees (Â°).

As an example of linear motion in Cartesian space, let the robotic arm move to point A \[300,0,150,180,0,0] first, and then to point B \[400,0,150,180,0,0].

```
arm.set_position(300,0,150,180,0,0)  
arm.set_position(400,0,150,180,0,0)
```

#### Speed

In the `set_position()` interface for linear motion, the speed is passed with the `speed` parameter, and the unit is mm/s.\
For example, let the robotic arm move to point A \[300,100,150,180,0,0] at 200 mm/s.

```
arm.set_position(300,100,150,180,0,0, speed=200)
```

#### Complete Example

```
from xarm.wrapper import XArmAPI  
arm = XArmAPI('192.168.1.47')  
arm.motion_enable(enable=True)  
arm.set_mode(0)  
arm.set_state(0)  
  
arm.set_position(300,0,150,180,0,0, speed=200)  
arm.set_position(400,0,150,180,0,0, speed=200)
```
