## 1.1.Gripper Introduction

The gripper is the end-effector of the robotic arm, which can grasp objects dynamically.

The value range of the gripper opening and closing is: -10 to 850. The larger the value, the greater the stroke of the gripper, meaning the smaller the value, the smaller the stroke of the gripper. If the clamping is not tight, a negative value can be set until it is tightened.

### 1.3.2.Risk Assessment and Final Application

The xArm Gripper is meant to be used on an industrial robot.

The robot, gripper and any other equipment used in the final application must be evaluated with a risk assessment. The robot integrator must ensure that all local safety measures and regulations are respected. Depending on the application, there may be risks that need additional protection/safety measures, for example, the work-piece the gripper is manipulating may be inherently dangerous to the operator.

### 1.3.3.Intended Use

The gripper is designed for grasping and temporarily securing or holding objects.
