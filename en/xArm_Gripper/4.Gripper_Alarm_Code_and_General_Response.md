# 4.Gripper Alarm Code & General Response

The user can re-power on the robotic arm as an error handling, the steps are as follows (all the following steps are needed):

1.Re-powering the robotic arm via the emergency stop button on the control box.


2.Enable the robotic arm.

* a. xArm Studio enable method: Click the guide button of the error pop-up window or the ‘STOP’ red button in the upper right corner.
* b. xArm-Python-SDK enable method: Refer to Error Handling Method.
* c.xArm_ros: users can view related documents at： https://github.com/xArm-Developer/xarm_ros
3. Re-enable the gripper.

If the problem remains unsolved after power on/off multiple times, please contact UFACTORY team for support.

**Appendix:**

xArm-Python-SDK alarm processing method:

When designing the robotic arm motion path with the Python library, if the robot fails, you need to manually clear the errors. After clearing the error, you still need to re-enable the robotic arm and set the robot to motion mode for the robot to move normally. Then the path planning of the robotic arm should be re-adjusted according to the reported error information.

Python library error clearing steps: (Please check GitHub for details on the following interfaces)

* a.error clearing: clean_error()

* b.Re-enable the robotic arm: motion_enable(true)

* c.Set the motion state: set_state(0)
