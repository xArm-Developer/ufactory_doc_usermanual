### 2. Check whether the robotic arm passes through or near the singularity.

Singularity judgment method and solution:

Please refer to the page 189-191 of the UFACTORY xArm user manual: [UFACTORY xArm user manual](https://www.ufactory.cc/pages/download-xarm)




**Note:** If the method above can't improve the jitter of the robotic arm, please send the information below to the support team.


1. The SN of the robotic arm.

2. The video about the jitter issue.

3. The script/command of the current movement.

4. The payload and its offset.
