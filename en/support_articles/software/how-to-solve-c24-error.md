# How to solve C24 error?

Product: xArm series, UF 850, Lite6

UFactory version: V2.1.0+

There are 2 reasons for C24 error:

1. The motion speed(calculated joint speed) is too high.
2. Singularity appears in the motion path.

### **1. Reduce TCP speed**

Reducing TCP motion speed/acceleration/jerk in the program.

### **2. Re-plan the path to the target point(Interpolation)**

### **3. Bypass singularities**

1) UFACTORY Studio: Settings-General-Advanced Settings-Bypassing Singularities.

2) Python SDK: set\_allow\_approx\_motion(self, on\_off)

### **Example**

1) Reduce TCP Speed

2) Re-plan the path

3) Enable 'Bypassing Singularities'.


**Note:** If the above methods can not solve your issue, please send the files below to the support team.
