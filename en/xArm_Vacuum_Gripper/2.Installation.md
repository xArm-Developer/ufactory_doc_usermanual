**Note:**

1. When turning on the vacuum gripper connection cable,be sure  to press-down the E-stop button and power off the robotic arm, and to ensure that power indicator of the robotic arm is off,as to avoid robotic arm failure caused by hot plugging;
 
2. Due to the length limitation of the vacuum head connection cable, the vacuum head connection and the end connection need to be in the same direction;

3. When connecting the vacuum gripper and the robotic arm,be sure to align the positioning holes on the two ends of the interface.The male pins of the connecting cable are relatively thin to avoid bending the male pins during disassembly.

4. Please remove the suction cup from the bottom or it might be broken easily.
