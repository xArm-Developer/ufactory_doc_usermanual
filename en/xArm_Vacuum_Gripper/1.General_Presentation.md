The vacuum gripper is ideal for picking up even workpieces less than 5 Kg. The vacuum gripper is equipped with 5 suction cups, which can be partially selected for use according to the size of the object surface, and the unused suction cup needs to be sealed. 

**Note:** 

If the surface of the object is not smooth, there will be air leakage from the suction cup which makes the object fail to be picked up firmly. 

Indicator status: When the vacuum gripper is powered on, the power supply indicator near the vacuum gripper is constantly red. When the vacuum gripper is on, the IO status indicator is constantly green.


## 1.2 **Setup and Control**

The vacuum gripper is powered and controlled directly via a single connection cable that carries a 24V DC supply and IO control.
