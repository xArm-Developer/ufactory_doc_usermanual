# 4. Gripper Error Code & Error Handling

The user can re-power on the robotic arm as an error handling, the steps are as follows (re-power on need to perform all the following steps):

1. Re-powering therobotic arm via the emergency stop button on the control box.

2. Enable robotic arm.

a. xArm Studio enable mode: Click the guide button of the error pop-up window or the ‘STOP’ red button in the upper right corner.

b. xArm-Python-SDK enable mode: Refer to Alarm Handling Mode.

c. xArm_ROS library: users can view related documents at https://github.com/xArm-Developer/xarm_ros



3. Re-enable the gripper.

| Error Code | Error Description | Error Handling |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 0x0B       | Gripper overcurrent | Re-enable the Gripper |
| 0x0C       | The gripping object falls off | Clear the error and set the 0x000F register to 0 |




If the problem remains unsolved after power on/off for multiple times, please contact UFACTORY team for support.

**xArm-Python-SDK Error Handling:**

When designing the robotic arm motion path with the Python library, if the robotic arm error (see Appendix for Alarm information) occurs, then it needs to be cleared manually. After clearing the error, the robotic arm should be motion enabled. 
Python library error clearing steps: (Please check GitHub for details on the following interfaces)

a.Eerror clearing: clean_error()

b.Re-enable the robotic arm: motion_enable(true)

c.Set the motion statu: set_statu(0)
