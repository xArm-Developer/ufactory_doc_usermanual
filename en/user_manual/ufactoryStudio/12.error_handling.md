# 12. Error Handling

## 12.1 Control Box Error Code and Handling  
If there is an error in the hardware of the robotic arm/the software of the Control Box/in sending commands, an error or warning will be issued. This error/warning signal will be fed back when the user sends any command;  The feedback is passive and not actively reported.  

After the above error occurs, the robotic arm will stop working immediately and discard the Control Box cache command. Users need to clear these errors manually to allow normal operation. Please re-plan the motion of the robotic arm according to the reported error message.

## 12.3 Python SDK Error Code and Handling  
When designing the robotic arm motion path with the Python library, if the robotic arm error (see Appendix for Alarm information) occurs, then it needs to be cleared manually. After clearing the error, the robotic arm should be motion enabled.   

Python library error clearing steps: (Please check GitHub for details on the following interfaces)
* error clearing: clean_error()
* Re-enable the robotic arm: motion_enable(true)
* Set the motion state: set_state(0)
